Average value, :math:`A(t) = \frac{1}{(m - p + 1)} \sum_{i=p}^{m} a_i`,The average, or mean, of a set of data points is simply the sum of all the data points divided by the total number of data points.,?,
Max value,:math:`max(s(t))`,,<3fT,
Variance,:math:` \text{Variance} = \frac{1}{(m - p + 1)} \sum_{i=p}^{m} (a_i - A(t))^2`,It is calculated by finding the average of the squared differences from the mean,?,
FFT (Fast Fourier Transform),,FFT is used to convert from time to frequency domain,<= 10 fT,
